 FP in java
 ---------------

 --> we need lambda-expression to write function( specific-behavior like compare,add,.. )
 --> we can write lambda expressions using Functional-interface ( type of Lambda )
 --> we can skip parameter types in LE due to compiler's Type-Inference ability
 --> Lambda expression can capture static, instance and local (must be effective final variables) from enclosing scope
 --> Java runtime, will try to use same LE as much as possible instead of re-creating
